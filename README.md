bookreader is a desktop app for reading .pdf and .epub

bookreader uses [electronjs](https://www.electronjs.org/) for rendering the app, and uses [epubjs](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js/) along with [pdfjs](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) for rendering epubs and pdfs respectively.

## Why bookreader

bookreader was created as an open source project due to the lack of desktop apps that read .epub extensions.

bookreader also simplifies the GUI of conventional file readers, making it easy for casual users.

## How to use it?

Click the 'Browse' button and search your file or you could just drag a file and drop it over and the app will load it for you.
